🧠 Project Description: 
This is my personal Portfolio Website designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.
It represents my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean, modern, and responsive layout.

🧩 Technologies Used

  1. HTML5
  2. CSS3
  3. Tailwind CSS (for responsive design and modern UI)
  4. Font Awesome (for icons)
  5. Google Fonts (Roboto Condensed & Open Sans)

⚙️ Challenges Faced: 

  - Structuring the layout with proper responsiveness across all screen sizes
  - Positioning and aligning grid and flex items correctly
  - Maintaining color balance and visual hierarchy
  - Implementing hover effects smoothly using Tailwind transitions
  - Managing spacing and padding to keep consistent design flow

🎯 Finishing & Outcome: 
After several design adjustments and layout refinements, the final website became fully responsive, visually balanced, and user-friendly.
It highlights my identity as a Front-End Developer and works as my digital resume for future opportunities.
